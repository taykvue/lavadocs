## Overview
Lavacon presentation [*"Leveraging Technology to Create Training Content that Can Make a World of Difference"*](https://www.engagez.net/lavacon#lct=customlocation-Location1-454156-calendar_154772_5ondemand) presented by Scott Yongblom explores creative training content using new technologies such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Intelligent Content Delivery as an effective means to reduce costs, increase productivity, and introduce a new, effective learning experience. As a result of the growing technology and business development, training content is vital to improving employee performance, customer satisfaction, consistency, and quality. Traditional methods of training (e.g., in-person training, text, videos, etc.) teaches employees "what to know" and lacks an engaging way of motivating employees to stride to apply what they learn. Whereas, new formats using AR, VR, and 3D interactive methods of training methods provide limitless, immersive experiences that give employees more practical experience to learn "what to do." These new ways of training can result in greater operational efficacy, better cost savings, lower risks, and provide an overall productive learning environment. 

## Key takeaways

Especially in our current status quo with the pandemic, it is important to note how traditional methods of teaching and training new employees is currently unreliable and unfeasible. As technical communicators, I think it is also vital to consider the variety of ways to conduct and convey information that will best adapt to our current situations. Such explorations of how new content using 3D interaction technology can provide quality training are essential. Three main takeaways from this presentation for technical communicators is that implementing new technology (VR, AR, 3D interactive) can:

* provide a greater production efficacy to meet business goals
* deliver safety measures to mitigate risks and concerns
* establish a dynamic learning platform for gaining hands-on experience


## Reflection

Employing new methods of design and technology like AR and VR can provide a better form of training content, and this connects with our class in Writing with Digital Technology because it is a valuable resource and learning material. Learning new training content using AR, VR, or other 3D interactive environments extends further current research that is important to know as technical communicators in our modern world filled with advanced technology. As a digital writer, I think this technology can help others understand information easier and apply it more efficiently. For example, instead of writing word for word instructions for readers, utilizing VR to give users the ability to see the computer parts that they can interact within a virtual world to build from scratch can be much more effective and useful. Overall, I think this presentation gives significant insights into how the implementation of new technology can provide a more valuable platform for training new employees.
